# Creating a Website on GitHub Pages

#### Objective provided by Codecademy:

**Put your work online using GitHub Pages – no command line required!**

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a tool provided by [GitHub](https://github.com/), lets you easily create and deploy a website online. GitHub allows you to store all the files and code for your website in a repository. You can then use GitHub Pages to generate a personal URL and share your site with friends, family, and the world!

For this tutorial, you need a GitHub account and basic HTML knowledge. You don’t need to know Git or the command line. (But if you do want to learn how to use these tools, check out our [Learn Git & GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) and [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) courses.)
